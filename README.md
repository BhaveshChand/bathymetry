# bathymetry

This repository contains code for project "Development of Software Tool for Bathymetry Mapping using Satellite Imagery".
I did this project as Summer Intern at Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, ISRO.

This is implentation of a software that is able to extract water depth and albedo information in coastal regions 
,using Stumpf's Algorithm on LandSat satellite imagery.
